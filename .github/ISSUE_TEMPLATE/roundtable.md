🙋🏻‍♀️ _what are [**weekly roundtables**](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/guidelines/roundtable.md) anyway? They are discussions of a Data Together-related topic, challenge, or question led by a rotating facilitator. If you are hosting, be sure to check out [**how to host**](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/guidelines/roundtable.md#how-to-host) (and add any improvements!)_
