## Data Together Weekly Roundtable Call

Once a week on **Mondays 5-5:30pm**, a rotating facilitator will lead a roundtable discussion of a Data Together-related topic, challenge, or question. We use a standing [Zoom call link](https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/455833201): [zoom.us/j/455833201](https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/455833201) and [GitHub `roundtable` issues](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/labels/roundtable) to run each call. **Check out [how to host](#how-to-host)** before running your first call.

### Objectives

- Check-in on **ongoing work** and surface **larger issues** that need to be discussed in-depth
- Allow **initial feedback** on developing ideas prior to opening a decision
- **Maintain momentum** between partner coordinating calls

### Format

Roundtables will rotate individuals who will facilitate discussion around a specific topic, problem, or task. Topics will be picked at least a week in advance. When scheduling, the goal will be to mix governance, topic area, and technical implementation questions. 

Example topics:
- check-in on decision-making process
- review website copy
- discuss open PR or design detail related to a reference implementation
- identify partnership & outreach opportunities

#### Timing

- **Mondays 5-5:30pm** (selected Feb 2018)
- Secondary slot: Thursdays 5-5:30pm (selected Feb 2018)

For faster-moving conversations the `#datatogether` slack channel and GitHub remain the place for topics that move faster than once weekly conversations, with goal of using github issues. Conversations can be scheduled ad-hoc then added to the calendar and announced in `#datatogether` to ensure others can join.

#### Schedule

- Intros and bullet-point updates (10mins)
- Roundtable (15mins)
  - aim for new leader each week
- Wrap-up (5mins)
  - identify TODOs
  - review upcoming meeting schedule

1. As host, your main goal is to facilitate conversation between attendees. Ask someone to help with notes as it is difficult to do everything at once!
