## Data Together Weekly Roundtable Call

Once a week on **Mondays 5-5:30pm**, a rotating facilitator will lead a round table discussion of a Data Together-related topic, challenge, or question. We use a standing [Zoom call link](https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/455833201): [zoom.us/j/455833201](https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/455833201) and [GitHub `roundtable` issues](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/labels/roundtable) to run each call. **Check out [how to host](#how-to-host)** before running your first call.

### Objectives

- Check-in on ongoing work and potentially surface larger issues that need to be discussed in-depth
- Allow initial feedback on developing ideas prior to opening a decision
- Maintain momentum going between larger coordinating calls

### Format

Meetings will rotate individuals leading a round table around a specific topic, problem, or task. Scheduling topics will interleave implementation, governance, and topic area questions. Round table topics will be picked at least a week in advance.

Example Round Table Topics:
- checking in on decision-making process
- reviewing website copy
- asking about and open PR or design detail related to a reference implementation
- identifying partnership & outreach opportunities

#### Timing

- **Mondays 5-5:30pm**
- Secondary slot: Thursdays 5-5:30pm

For faster-moving conversations the `#datatogether` slack channel and GitHub remain the place for topics that move faster than once weekly conversations, with goal of using github issues. Conversations can be scheduled ad-hoc then added to the calendar and announced in `#datatogether` to ensure others can join.

#### Schedule

- Intros and bullet-point updates (10mins)
- Round Table (15mins)
  - aim for new leader each week
- Wrap-up (5mins)
  - identify TODOs
  - review upcoming meeting schedule

### How to Host

1. Start a GitHub issue in [`datatogether/datatogether`](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/issues/new) with the title "Roundtable: [Topic] [Date (optional)]"
    Add in any details, relevant links, and indicate that you are willing to host a call by assigning yourself to the issue!
1. If you haven't already, set a date for your discussion! (This should be in the title of the GitHub issue), you can see potential [roundtable topics](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/labels/roundtable)
1. Make sure you show up to host the call!
1. As host, your main goal is to facilitate conversation between attendees. Ask someone to help with notes as it is difficult to do everything at once!
1. Review the [call schedule](#schedule) above, ensuring that you leave time for introductions if anyone new is on the call (and ask for brief updates). Also make sure you leave at least 5 minutes at the end to identify TODOs and set the next meeting
