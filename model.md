The *verification* problem can be solved by cryptographic signing (implemented in IPFS)  
The *authority* problem can be solved by webs of trust (to be implemented in Data Together app)  
The *discovery* problem can be solved by ??? (archivers has a “coverage” service that might be a model, but ultimately this should be decentralized, right?)  
The *access* problem feels like a complex one, actually.
