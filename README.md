Data Together
========
> Community Patterns for the Decentralized Web

We are engaging in a collaborative process to more clearly describe Data Together so that the initiative can be better understood by newcomers. This process began during an in-person meeting in Boston on August 29, 2017 with @dcwalk, @flyingzumwalt, @jeffreyliu, @mhucka, @ebarry, @b5, @jschell42, @titaniumbones, @rgardaphe.

We are starting with time-tested patterns from non-profits, collaboratives, and companies: Mission, Vision, Values. Please click on the links below to see and comment on the draft text:    

* **Mission** -- our purpose for existing, our charge, our goal, what this initiative does. (1 succinct sentence only)

* _[if there’s extra on “how” we do our work, add **model / strategic plan / initiative areas**]_

* **Vision** -- our future abilities and role in broader movement, NOT a utopian static state. Meant to be inspirational to ourselves + partners to strive together, and can be more flowery than the mission

* _[if there’s extra on “why” / the need and motivation, add **problem statement / historical context**]_

* **Values** -- single words with short sentence fragment descriptions. (5 max)

* _[also, note useful **elevator pitches** -- the “all-in-one” sentences that efficiently go from the problem to the solution]_
