# Data Together

### <em>Data Together empowers people to create a decentralized civic layer for the web, leveraging community, trust, and shared interest to steward data they care about.</em>

Find out about who we are, what we do, and how to get involved at https://datatogether.org/)!

## Organizational structure

We maintain pretty light governance but commit to an annual in-person meeting and quarterly calls:

### Quarterly Calls
[**Quarterly calls**](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/guidelines/roundtable.md) are held four times annually, for everyone, but especially Data Together partners to sync up on ongoing projects, what is going on in their organizations, and more.

üìÖ Once per quarter
