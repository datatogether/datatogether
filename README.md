## Getting Involved

We are engaging in a collaborative process to more clearly describe Data Together so that the initiative can be better understood by newcomers. This process began during an in-person meeting in Boston on August 29, 2017 with [@dcwalk](https://github.com/dcwalk), [@flyingzumwalt](https://github.com/flyingzumwalt), [@jeffreyliu](https://github.com/jeffreyliu), [@mhucka](https://github.com/mhucka), [@ebarry](https://github.com/ebarry), [@b5](https://github.com/b5), [@jschell42](https://github.com/jschell42), [@titaniumbones](https://github.com/titaniumbones), [@rgardaphe](https://github.com/rgardaphe). We are starting with time-tested patterns from non-profits, collaboratives, and companies: Mission, Vision, Values. Please click on the links below to see and comment on the draft text.

## Mission

_Our purpose for existing, our charge, our goal, what this initiative does. (1 succinct sentence only)_

Data Together helps communities steward the data they care about.

_[if there’s extra on “how” we do our work, add **[model](/model.md) / strategy / strategic plan / initiative areas**]_

## Vision 

_Our future abilities and role in broader movement, NOT a utopian static state. Meant to be inspirational to ourselves and partners to strive together, and can be more flowery than the mission_.

Together we are the civic layer of the decentralized web where communities work cooperatively, share responsibilities, and reinforce each other so that data is accessible to all, immediately discoverable, easily verifiable, and robustly preserved.

_[if there’s extra on “why” / the need and motivation, add **[problem statement](/problem.md) / historical context**]_

## Values

_These are single words with short sentence fragment descriptions. (5 max)_

* **SELF-SUFFICIENCY** &ndash; Develop according to the principle of Swadeshi
* **RESPECT** &ndash; Create safer and inclusive spaces through intentional actions and governance mechanisms  
* **MUTUAL AID** &ndash; “With, not for”&ndash;Support people and organizations contributing resources according to their abilities in order to achieve greater benefit, in aggregate, for the whole community  
* **OPENNESS** &ndash; Make decisions and coordinate openly and transparently  

_[also, note useful **elevator pitches** -- the “all-in-one” sentences that efficiently go from the problem to the solution]_
